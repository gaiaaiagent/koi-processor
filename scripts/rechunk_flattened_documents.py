"""Re-chunk documents whose chunks were flattened by the pre-2026-08-14 chunker.

Background. `api/chunker.py` rebuilt every chunk as `' '.join(text.split())`,
which silently destroyed newlines, indentation and column alignment at ingest.
Fixed in koi-processor-runtime 65b8b57 and koi-processor b5d5aac7. The fix only
affects NEW ingests: re-running an ingest is idempotent on the content hash of
the source bytes, which have not changed, so damaged documents never self-heal.

The migration is cheap and entirely local because the damage was only ever at the
chunk layer. `koi_memories.content->>'text'` still holds the full original
document with its whitespace intact -- verified on The Working with Stories
Sourcebook, whose stored text carries 30 paired-pole lines and 251 column runs
while all 196 of its chunks carry zero of each and no newline at all. Nothing has
to be re-fetched; the source of truth is already in the database.

Damage signature, and why it is conservative:

    the stored full text contains a newline
    AND no chunk of that document contains one

A document with no newlines in its source is not damaged, it is simply flat, so
requiring the source to have them avoids rewriting documents that were always
fine. Documents are re-embedded, which costs money, so the selection is
deliberately narrow rather than "re-chunk everything".

Safety. Embedding happens for the whole document BEFORE anything is deleted, and
the swap runs inside a transaction, so a failure mid-document leaves the existing
chunks untouched rather than leaving it chunkless. The pre-existing
`upsert_document_chunks` is reused so chunk rids, metadata and the 3072-dim
column match exactly what a normal ingest writes.

SCOPE. `--rid-like` defaults to `document:%`, which is what the 2026-08-14 run used.
That run reported COMPLETE and was complete for that namespace: 303 documents, and
0 remain. It was NOT complete for the corpus. Re-measured 2026-08-17 with the prefix
removed: 12,798 further damaged documents / 46,793 chunks, under

    orn:              7,607   (gmail + sensor ingests)
    mediawiki:        4,201   (P2P Foundation wiki)
    doc-scanner:        604
    substack-corpus:    386

Spot-checked by hand on the largest (orn:gmail.message:0b85114133132933, 364 KB): its
stored text carries paragraph breaks and its first chunk has them collapsed to single
spaces, which is the signature exactly. Pass `--rid-like '%'` to scan everything;
the dry run prints a cost estimate before anything is spent.
