"""Shared helper for emitting federation domain events from mutation endpoints.

Usage in routers:
    from api.federation_events import emit_domain_event
    await emit_domain_event("entity", "NEW", rid, payload)

For knowledge-domain emits that require idempotent subscriber behavior:
    event_id = uuid.uuid4()
    await emit_domain_event(
        "knowledge_episode", "NEW", rid, payload,
        payload_event_id=str(event_id),
    )
The caller-supplied event_id is BOTH passed to the queue (for queue-level
dedup via UNIQUE (source_node, event_id, target_node)) AND injected into
payload as `_federation_event_id` (for subscriber-level dedup via the
federation_applied_events table — see migration 100).

The event_queue is set during app startup by personal_ingest_api.py.
If federation is not enabled, calls are silently no-ops.

Feature flag KOI_FEDERATE_KNOWLEDGE gates the three knowledge-related
domains only ('knowledge_episode', 'knowledge_fact', 'document_entity_link').
Other domains (entity, claim, attestation, commitment, etc.) are not
affected by the flag. Default off — flip to "true" per node after
subscriber handlers are deployed.
