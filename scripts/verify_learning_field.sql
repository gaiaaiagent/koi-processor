-- Learning Field Phase 1 Verification Checklist
-- Run: psql personal_koi -f scripts/verify_learning_field.sql
--
-- Expected baseline (batch 20260403T210752Z):
--   49 source claims, 82 review claims, 50 concepts, 50 questions
--   137 supports, 6 opposes, 50 about (Q→C), 23 related_to
--   0 orphaned review claims, 2 cross-project concepts
--   Versioning: implemented but latent (0 supersedes until a note is edited)
