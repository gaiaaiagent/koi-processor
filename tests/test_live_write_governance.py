"""The live-write gate, expressed as a property rather than a list of filenames.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
On 2026-08-22 four defects escaped the repo's gates in a single day, none going
red. One cause: every gate here ENUMERATES. The red baseline names eight files.
`live_graph_tripwire` named one table (so it reported "0 test-signature rows
written" while 135 task rows landed). `pytest.ini` names no `testpaths`, so four
`test_*.py` files outside `tests/` collect with no conftest, no DSN redirect and
no tripwire at all. Anything outside the enumeration fails silently, and silence
reads as safety.

This gate instead DERIVES its population from the filesystem and asserts a
property of it:

    every test that writes to the live API over HTTP either cleans up after
    itself, or is named here with a reason.

A newly-added leaking test therefore fails on the day it is written, without
anyone remembering to update a list.

WHY THE DETECTOR IS DELIBERATELY OVER-INCLUSIVE
-----------------------------------------------
A false positive costs one line in KNOWN_UNGOVERNED. A false negative cost 627
leaked rows in `task_registry` and 1,310 in `intent_registry`. So the patterns
below match broadly and the allowlist absorbs the noise.

That bias was learned the hard way *while writing this file*: the first detector
matched only `.post(`/`.patch(` and missed `scripts/test_claims_api.py`, which
uses `urllib.request`. The second added `method="POST"` and missed it again,
because that file passes the verb positionally as `_req("POST", ...)`. Two
iterations, two different misses, same file — which is why
`test_detector_still_matches` exists: if these patterns silently stop matching,
the two assertions below pass trivially and this gate becomes decoration.

NO HTTP, NO DATABASE. This is a static scan. A gate that needs a live backend
skips when the backend is slow, and a skip that reads as a pass is the exact
failure that produced a bad red baseline on 2026-08-21.
