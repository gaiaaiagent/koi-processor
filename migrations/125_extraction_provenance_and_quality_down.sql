-- 125_extraction_provenance_and_quality_down — reverse 125.
-- =============================================================================
-- ⚠ THIS DESTROYS DATA THAT ONLY LIVES HERE.
--
-- 125 added columns and a table; nothing else writes the provenance receipts or
-- the semantic verdicts, so dropping them is the only copy gone. That is why the
-- export below runs FIRST and why it is placed BELOW `\set ON_ERROR_STOP on`:
-- above it, a failed export exits 0 and psql continues straight into the DROPs.
-- (Migration 123's down file shipped with its export lines commented out and a
-- reviewer ran it, destroying 511 rows at exit 0. Same shape, so: same fix.)
--
-- Paths are LITERAL. `\copy` does not interpolate :'var' inside a filename — a
-- repair that tried to parameterise this was silently broken by exactly that.
-- =============================================================================

\set ON_ERROR_STOP on

-- Export first. If either of these fails, ON_ERROR_STOP aborts before any DROP.
