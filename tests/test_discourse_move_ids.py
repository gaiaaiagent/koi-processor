"""The discourse-move id derivation is a PERSISTENT CONTRACT, pinned here by value.

`scripts/extract_deep_documents.py` writes document discourse moves with
`uuid5(DISCOURSE_NAMESPACE, f"{document_rid}:{move_type}:{key(title)}:{chunk_start}")`
and upserts `ON CONFLICT (id)`. Every row already in `session_discourse_moves`
(13,767 rows across 1,507 documents when this was written) was derived with
`key = lower + strip + collapse whitespace` — nothing else. The M6 fix (`cdc445c`)
rebound the module's `_norm` to the entity normalizer (`normalize_entity_text`,
which also folds `-`/`_` to a space and strips a leading `@`) and the move-id hash
input silently changed with it: 5,578 stored rows on 1,169 documents would no
longer match their own id, so a replay would INSERT a duplicate beside each stale
row it was meant to repair (re-review of PR #66, the one remaining merge blocker).

These tests pin EXACT UUIDs computed with the historical derivation. They are
literals on purpose: a test that recomputes the expected value through the code
under test cannot notice the code changing. The hyphen-free title is the positive
control — it is stable under both normalizers, so it passes before and after the
fix and proves the failing cases fail for the reason claimed.
