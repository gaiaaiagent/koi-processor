"""A merged-away entity must never reach a reader, and must never be written to.

`/entities/merge` TOMBSTONES the loser — sets `merged_into`, keeps the row, keeps its
`entity_text`, `aliases` and `embedding_3072` so history stays resolvable. That is a good
design and it has one consequence nothing accounted for: **every merge ever performed
leaves a row that still matches by name and still competes in the ANN.** 202 exist; 167
share `normalized_text` with the live survivor they point at.

Commit 00a3049 fixed this in `api/retrieval_executors.py` and only there. The sweep that
followed found the same shape at ten more sites — including `/knowledge/unified-search`,
whose top hit for "Pol.is" was `schema:softwareapplication-pol.is-568dbb48`, a tombstone
merged into `softwareapplication-polis-b6aedccc`, which is *itself* a tombstone merged
into the live `concept-pol.is-053fa414`. Doubly dead, ranked first, on the tool the global
CLAUDE.md tells every session to call before anything else.

Two behaviours, and using the wrong one causes a different bug:

  RETRIEVAL — exclude. The survivor is in the same index, so a tombstone is a pure
  duplicate that costs a result slot and can be cited by an LLM under a dead URI.

  RESOLUTION — follow. Excluding here is worse than doing nothing: the lookup misses,
  falls through to create_new, and mints a THIRD row for a name that already has a
  canonical home. 53 `knowledge_facts` rows (21 subject, 32 object) are already bound to
  tombstoned URIs because the resolution path did neither.

These tests assert the two rules over the query text itself, which is the only way to
catch the *next* site rather than re-fixing these. A live-DB test would pass on any query
that happens not to have a tombstone in range today.
