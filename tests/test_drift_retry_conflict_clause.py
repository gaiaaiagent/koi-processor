"""`_insert_with_drift_retry` must survive drift in columns named by ON CONFLICT.

THE BUG THIS PINS
-----------------
The helper drops an undefined column from the INSERT value list and retries. But
`conflict_clause` was a fixed string re-interpolated verbatim on every attempt,
so a column named in BOTH the INSERT and the `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET` was
dropped from one and left in the other. The retry raised the identical
`UndefinedColumnError`, and because the column was no longer in `cv`, the
`col not in cv` guard re-raised it as `federation.drift.unparseable`.

Net effect: drift-retry silently protected only columns ABSENT from the conflict
clause — which, for both live call sites (`knowledge_episodes` at the episode
handler, `knowledge_facts` at the fact handler), is almost none. The protection
read as present and was mostly not there.

Found 2026-08-22 while assessing whether `_apply_entity` could be routed through
this helper to make migration-vs-code ordering safe. It could not: the column at
issue, `resolution_tier`, appears in both halves — so the proposed fix would have
failed in a new way rather than working.

The COALESCE case is not hypothetical. `knowledge_episodes` ships
`group_id = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.group_id, knowledge_episodes.group_id)`, whose
inner comma breaks any naive split on ",".
