"""Policy for landing federated DOCUMENTS into local RAG storage.

This module holds the three decisions that gate the `document` federation
domain, deliberately separated from the handler itself (`domain_event_handlers.
_apply_document`) so each is testable without a database:

1. **Is the feature on at all?** `KOI_FEDERATE_DOCUMENTS`, default **off**.
   `regen-prod` rsyncs to the NUC, whose operator has not opted in to receiving
   a new dispatcher + document sink. Default-off keeps that node byte-identical
   in behaviour until it sets the flag itself.
2. **Is this RID allowed to land?** Server-side `rid_types` edge scoping is
   verified ineffective for `regen.newsletter:` RIDs — `extract_rid_type()`
   returns None for them and the poll filter only skips when a type *is*
   extracted. Containment therefore has to be enforced here, on the receiving
   side, or an over-broad edge silently lands unrelated coordinator content.
3. **Who wrote it?** Coordinator newsletter bundles carry a `document.author`
   key whose value is **null in all 448 bundles measured** (2026-08-21). The
   key existing is not the value existing. Author is therefore DERIVED from
   `newsletter_slug` via an explicit table, and an unmapped slug is a loud
   failure — a null author is exactly what lets "what does Nate say" answer
   confidently with Nate Hagens (476 of his documents are already indexed).

None of these fail open. An empty allowlist allows nothing; an unmapped slug
raises; an unset flag disables the path entirely.

    - A tracking pixel is not provenance. It does not resolve to the post and

    - It is PII. `metadata.source_url` is copied onto every chunk so that search
      results can cite the source, which is precisely where a subscriber's email
      address should not appear.

    This deliberately does NOT reconstruct the URL by scanning the body: only 22
    of the 112 contain a canonical `/p/` link at all, and a body scan can match a
    link to a *different* post that the author referenced — producing a
    confidently wrong provenance link, which is worse than an absent one. The

      provenance and integrity checking are unaffected. Only the INDEXED copy
      is redacted.
    - A quotation that happened to include the address will read with a
      placeholder. In this corpus every occurrence is Substack's own
      "you're receiving this at <address>" furniture, not authored prose.
    - Redacting a tracking token leaves the surrounding URL intact but inert.
      Those URLs are already refused as `source_url` (see `canonical_url`).
