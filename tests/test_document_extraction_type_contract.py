"""The deep-document extraction type contract, and the drift it exists to catch.

Issue #68. Before this module the entity-type vocabulary was written out by hand in
six places with nothing comparing them, and `Document` and `Event` were missing from
all six while the live registry had already marked both `extractable = true`. The
result was not a bad answer — it was a STRUCTURALLY FORBIDDEN one: a dated gathering
could only come out `Organization`, a named essay could only come out `Project`.

These tests are the comparison that did not exist. Every one of them fails if a
surface is edited by hand, and each has a positive control proving it can fail — a
drift test that cannot fail is the same shape of nothing as the enum it replaced.

None of the contract tests need a database, a network, or an API key. A test that
skips is a test that does not exist, and this vocabulary is exactly the kind of
thing that would drift for months inside a skipped test.
