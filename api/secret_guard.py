"""Reject credential-shaped facts at the write path, loudly.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The extraction pipeline minted real credentials into knowledge_facts as ordinary
facts: HAS_PASSWORD (24 chars), HAS_TOKEN x3 (32-char lowercase hex, on the TELUS
node entities), SSH_USERNAME. All source=claude-session, all current for ~4.5
months, all served by the unauthenticated :8351 API. Retracted 2026-09-01.

None of those four predicates appears in any vocabulary. A generated closed
predicate list (the ontology work) would have prevented the class at the source;
this guard is the boundary check until that lands, and remains useful after,
because it also inspects VALUES.

CALIBRATED AGAINST REAL DATA, NOT INVENTED CONTROLS
---------------------------------------------------
Measured 2026-09-02 against live knowledge_facts:

  positive control  9 real credential facts (retracted rows survive with
                    valid_to set, so the actual values were available)
                    -> 8/9 caught
  negative control  1,233 legitimate no-whitespace literals >=16 chars
                    (URLs, filesystem paths, RIDs, slugs, hashes)
                    -> 1 false positive (0.081%)

Two things that calibration caught which reading the code would not have:

1. The three real HAS_TOKEN values are 32-char *lowercase hex* -- NOT mixed
   case+digits. A "high entropy AND mixed character classes" test, which is the
   obvious thing to write, MISSES all three. An invented positive control would
   have passed while the real secrets walked through.

2. `\bTOKEN\b` never matches HAS_TOKEN, because '_' is a word character so there
   is no word boundary. An early version of this pattern was silently inert on
   the exact real-world case. The patterns below use plain substrings.

The value rule earned its place independently: it found USES_TOKEN on
project-node-2 -- a 32-char hex token, still current, same date and same subject
URI as a retracted HAS_TOKEN row, missed by the predicate-name cleanup.

KNOWN GAP, deliberately not closed here: SSH_USERNAME is not caught. A 10-char
username has no value-shape signal and USERNAME is not in the operator-specified
predicate pattern. Widening it is an operator decision, not this module's.
