# Daily deep-extraction of newly-ingested substack-corpus posts into the discourse graph.
#
# The substack sensor (substack_sensor.py, scheduled separately ~07:15) only INGESTS +
# embeds new posts — it does NOT deep-extract them. This job runs after it (~07:45), finds
# every substack-corpus:* post that has no completed deep-extraction yet, and runs the
# thorough-tier extractor (entities + facts + discourse moves) on each.
#
# Generalized to ALL substack-corpus feeds (not just indyjohar) via the source_sensor
# filter. Idempotent + resumable: extract_deep_documents.py caches windows and takes a
# per-doc advisory lock, so overlap with a manual run or a re-fire is safe. Sequential —
# daily volume is 0-2 posts; no need for concurrency.
#
# Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY credits (the extractor's pay-per-token key). If that key is
# dry, posts fail individually and are logged; the job exits cleanly (no crash-loop) and
# the next run retries them (resumable).
