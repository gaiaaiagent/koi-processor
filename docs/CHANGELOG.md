# Changelog

All notable changes to the KOI Processor project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.2.1] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **Tier 1.1 Alias Resolution** - Entity aliases stored in vault frontmatter now resolve to canonical entities
  - New `normalize_alias()` helper strips wikilinks and normalizes for matching
  - Aliases stored in `entity_registry.aliases` TEXT[] column with GIN index
  - Resolution: "Gnosis" (mentioned) → "Knowsys" (canonical) via alias match @ 100% confidence
  - `/register-entity` now syncs aliases from frontmatter to backend
  - Migration 036: Enforces TEXT[] type for aliases column (aligns with production DB)

- **Vault Parser Predicate Mappings** - Added support for `creator` and `lead` fields
  - `creator` → `has_founder` (incoming, Person) - same semantics as `founders`
  - `lead` → `involves_person` (outgoing, Person)

- **Schema Loading Diagnostics** - Enhanced logging for vault schema loading
  - Logs vault path, individual schema names, and phonetic_matching status
  - Helps debug when schemas fail to load or have unexpected settings

### Fixed
- **Entity Resolution False Positives** - "Gnosis" no longer creates duplicate entity when "Knowsys" exists with alias
  - Root cause: Aliases in frontmatter weren't being read or matched during resolution
  - Fix: Tier 1.1 alias matching inserted after exact match, before contextual matching

## [3.2.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **Enhanced Contextual Entity Resolution** - Multi-hop relationship-aware resolution
  - Per-entity `associated_people` and `associated_organizations` context fields
  - Organization and project context for disambiguation
  - Phonetic matching (Double Metaphone) for name variants (e.g., "Sean" → "Shawn")
  - 2-hop resolution paths: Person → Org → Project
  - Predicates: `affiliated_with`, `founded`, `has_founder`, `involves_person`
  - Result: "Sean Anderson" + Symbiocene Labs context → "Shawn Anderson" @ 93.4% confidence

- **Proto Support for Code Graph** - Cosmos SDK cross-language linking
  - ProtoMessage, ProtoService, ProtoRPC, ProtoEnum entity types
  - Enables proto → Go struct → TypeScript type linking
  - Module hierarchy with BELONGS_TO and CONTAINS edges

- **Local BGE Embedding Server** - `src/core/bge_server_local.py`
  - Privacy-preserving embeddings using BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
  - No data leaves the machine - suitable for personal KOI deployment

- **GitHub Webhook Handler** - `api/github_webhook.py`
  - Receives push events and triggers code extraction
  - Environment-configurable paths (CODE_GRAPH_BASE_PATH, REGEN_REPOS_PATH)

- **Phonetic Code Backfill** - `scripts/backfill_phonetic_codes.py`
  - Utility to populate phonetic_code for schema-enabled entity types
  - Supports per-type stopwords and idempotent execution

### Changed
- **Vault Parser** - Added `parentorg` predicate mapping for Project → Organization
- **Entity Resolution** - Relationships synced from vault: 3 → 112

### Fixed
- **has_founder Direction** - Corrected to Person (subject) → Org (object)
- **Frontmatter Sync** - Backend accepts both `frontmatter` and `properties` fields

## [3.1.5] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **Weekly Digest Stale Cache** - Date-range aware caching for `/api/koi/weekly-digest`
  - Root cause: Cache lookup ignored `start_date`/`end_date` params, returning 6+ day old digests
  - Fix: Cache filename now includes date range (`weekly_digest_{start}_to_{end}.md`)
  - Affected files: `content_dashboard.py`, `weekly_curator_llm.py`

- **Event Bridge Routing** - Forwarder now targets correct endpoint
  - Root cause: Forwarder posted to semantic bridge (port 8004) instead of v2 bridge (port 8100)
  - Fix: `EVENT_BRIDGE_URL=http://localhost:8100`, `EVENT_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT=/process-koi-event`

- **Fuseki Provenance 401** - Added Basic Auth support for provenance writes
  - Root cause: `provenance_to_rdf.py` didn't authenticate with Fuseki
  - Fix: Added `FUSEKI_USER`/`FUSEKI_PASSWORD` env var support
  - Runbook: `docs/runbook-fuseki-provenance.md`

### Changed
- **Pipeline Health** - All event flow components verified working:
  - Sensors → Coordinator → Forwarder → Event Bridge v2 → BGE → koi_embeddings ✅
  - Provenance → Fuseki ✅

## [3.1.4] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- **FIX-020: Alias Audit & Merge Scripts** - Entity deduplication tooling
  - `scripts/alias_audit.py` - Generates audit report of alias entities matching canonical_entities.json
  - `scripts/apply_alias_merges.py` - Applies safe merges with backup tables
  - Merged 8 alias entities into their canonical counterparts
  - Backup tables: `alias_merge_backup_20251229_*`

  - Standardized checklist for validating extraction quality
  - Companion script: `scripts/post_extraction_audit.sh`

## [3.1.3] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Stage6 Predicate Guard Bypass** - Fixed `stage6_full_reextract_gemini.py` not applying predicate normalization
  - Root cause: Script used `normalize_predicate()` (snake_case only) instead of `validate_predicate()` (applies PREDICATE_MAPPINGS)
  - Fix: Import and use `validate_predicate()` from `predicate_guard.py` after basic normalization
  - Result: Non-canonical predicates like `exploring` now correctly map to `discusses`

### Added
- **Week 20 Predicate Mappings** - 8 new mappings in `predicate_guard.py`:
  - `used_in` → `uses`, `handles` → `processes`, `powers` → `powered_by`
  - `managed_by` → `manages`, `implemented_in` → `implements`, `co_founded` → `founded`
  - `developed` → `creates`, `funded_by` → `funds`

### Changed
- **Week 20 QA Documentation** - Updated `docs/archive/knowledge-graph-review-2026-01.md`
  - Phase A: Predicate regrowth analysis (66 non-canonical from Week 19 → fixed)
  - Phase B: Quality spot-check (94% acceptable, threshold 85%)
  - Phase C: GraphRAG eval (100% resolution, threshold 70%)

## [3.1.2] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- **E401: Entity Documents Privacy Filter Order** - Fixed `/entity/documents` endpoint returning 0 docs for entities like "ethereum"
  - Root cause: Privacy filter applied AFTER `LIMIT` in CTE; for entities where first docs in index order were private, all results filtered out
  - Fix: Moved `JOIN koi_memories` + privacy filter INTO the `entity_docs` CTE before `LIMIT`
  - Verified: ethereum, regen ledger, regen commons, cosmos sdk, polygon all now return docs correctly

### Changed
- **Week 10 Closeout Documentation** - Updated `docs/archive/knowledge-graph-review-2026-01.md`
  - Added E401 fix details and verification results
  - Added Week 11 placeholder with backlog items

  - Enable with `DEBUG_GRAPH_EXPANSION=true`

### Changed
- **Normalized Text Index** - Entity lookup now uses `normalized_text` B-Tree index
  - Was: `LOWER(entity_text)` (computed per query)
  - Now: `normalized_text` (indexed column)
  - Includes `entity_type` in results for debugging
- **Multi-Token Seed Filter** - Expansion seeds filtered to >= 2 words OR >= 8 chars
  - Prevents single-token names ("gregory") from exploding to 1000+ docs
  - Reduces noise in graph expansion analysis
- **High-Degree Entity Guard** - Skips expensive COUNT when neighbors > 10
  - Avoids slow queries on high-connectivity entities
- **Removed `entity_uris` Propagation** - Cleaned up unused field from entity search CTEs
  - Was aggregating URIs but never using them (switched to name-based lookup)

### Fixed
- **PM2 Process Conflict** - Identified and resolved dual-user PM2 issue
  - Two `hybrid-rag-api` processes (darren + shawn) competing for port 8301
  - Shawn's old process was intercepting all requests
  - Resolution: Stop shawn's process, let darren's take over

## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- **Hybrid Search Keyword Scoring** - Fixed `keyword_score: 0` in search results
  - Root cause: RID mismatch between entity chunks (`UUID#chunk14`) and keyword base docs (`UUID`)

## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

1. **Database Migration Required**
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d eliza < migrations/003_create_isolated_koi_tables.sql
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Changes**
   - Add `USE_ISOLATED_TABLES=true` to your .env file
   - Review new options in .env.example

3. **Code Changes**
   - Replace `koi_event_bridge.py` with `koi_event_bridge_v2.py`
   - Update any custom integrations to handle version fields in responses

4. **Testing**
   - Run `scripts/test_pipeline.py` to verify the upgrade
   - Check deduplication is working with duplicate RID tests

### Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to v1.0.0:
1. Set `USE_ISOLATED_TABLES=false` in .env
2. Use `koi_event_bridge.py` instead of v2
3. The isolated tables can remain - they won't be used

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-20

### Added - Hybrid Graph-Boosted RAG

**Major Feature: Entity-Aware Knowledge Retrieval**

The KOI Query API now implements a sophisticated Hybrid Graph-Boosted RAG system that combines:
- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity using BGE-1024 embeddings
- **Entity/Graph Search**: Knowledge graph traversal via entity-chunk links
- **Keyword Search**: Full-text search with PostgreSQL tsvector

**Key Components:**

1. **Entity Registry** (koi_entity_registry)
   - Canonical entity storage with type information
   - Semantic deduplication (Tier 1: Exact, Tier 2: Embedding similarity)
   - 12,985 unique entities, 43,430 mentions, 70.10% dedup rate

2. **Entity-Chunk Links** (koi_entity_chunk_links)
   - 614,021 entity-memory associations
   - Enables graph-based document retrieval
   - Source: PostgreSQL entity extraction pipeline

3. **Weighted Average Fusion** (adaptive-features.ts)
   - Formula: 0.6*vector + 0.2*entity + 0.2*keyword + 0.15*entity_boost 
   - Entity boost applied when document appears in both vector and entity results

4. **Source-Diversity Sampling**
   - Prevents high-volume sources (GitHub) from drowning out high-value sources (Homepage)
   - Partitions entity results by source type: web, github, gitlab, other
   - Domain-level diversity for web: regen.network, forum, registry, guides
   - Top 25 from each non-web source, top 10 from each web domain

**Performance:**
- Quality: 99.7% (up from 62%)
- Entity extraction: 3,497 documents processed
- Zero type collisions in entity registry

### Changed
- Entity search now uses source-diversity sampling instead of simple LIMIT
- Fusion algorithm changed from RRF to Weighted Average for better score discrimination
- Added superseded_at IS NULL filter to all search queries

### Technical Details
See docs/HYBRID_RAG_ARCHITECTURE.md for complete technical documentation.
