"""Local review of cross-source discourse candidates (issue #60, increment I1).

Read-only over KOI. It lists stored candidates for a person to judge and appends
that person's annotations to a local JSONL file they name. It never writes to the
database, never admits or declines a candidate, never changes a retrieval limit
and never hides a stored candidate: pairs from one work move to their own lane
and stay listed.

What it shows comes in three kinds, kept apart:
  facts      the same-work and author mappings an operator supplies in a file
  cues       a claim's text containing an author name the mapping lists for the
             other source, or two sources from one publication feed. String
             and identifier matches only: not verified citation, restatement
             or dependence of evidence
  judgments  only what a reviewer records. Nothing here infers restatement,
             evidence dependence, support or an answer to a question.

An annotation binds to the candidate (id and key) and to the exact text and
source version shown, and names its reviewer as declared. It is appended,
never edited: a correction is a new line that supersedes an earlier one. A is
the claim being studied. In a candidate review A is the stored query (its first
sighting's); in a sighting review (--seen-in-run) A is that sighting's query,
the annotation records the anchor and the sighting, and reviews of the two
directions stay separate.

Tiers belong to occurrences, not to candidates. An occurrence is one sighting
of the pair by one completed run: the run, the claim whose search found it and
its pick (position among that search's picks, 1-based), from the run's effect
rows. Picks 1-5 are the first five (what the default per-claim limit keeps);
6 and later are additional. A sighting recorded before picks were recorded is
first five when its run kept at most five per claim, and unknown otherwise:
never guessed. The same pair can be first five in one run and additional in
another.

A batch chosen by a filter or made of sightings is written as two files
(make_split_batch): a reviewer file, which is all a reviewer receives, and an
operator binding file, which holds the candidate ids, runs, anchors, tiers and
the selection. Annotation needs both and checks them against each other
(bind_split). A plain batch stays one file, exactly as before (make_batch).
