"""`/health` must answer "do embeddings work", not "was an object constructed".

The field read `"embedding_available": embedding_provider is not None` — true whenever a
provider object existed at startup, which is true whenever an API key is configured,
which says nothing about whether the account has credit. On 2026-08-17 the OpenAI
balance was exhausted for 45 minutes and `/health` reported `embedding_available: true`
next to `"status": "healthy"` for the whole window.

That field is a gate, not a display:

    tests/eval/run_eval.py:1124        if not health.get("embedding_available")
    scripts/koi_sustained_write.py:213 raise SystemExit("PREFLIGHT FAIL: ...")

Both would have passed into a run that could not embed a single row. The name always
promised capacity; only the value was wrong.

It now reads the embedding-repair job's canary state, and the property under test is
that it FAILS CLOSED. Every way of not knowing — file missing, unreadable, stale, or the
provider in backoff — must report false. The tempting fallback ("if we can't tell, fall
back to whether a provider object exists") is precisely the original bug, so these tests
exist mainly to stop someone reintroducing it as a kindness.
