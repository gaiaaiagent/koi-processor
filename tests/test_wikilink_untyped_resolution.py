"""The untyped wikilink tier must be able to run, and nested vault folders must keep their type.

THE DEFECT THIS PINS
--------------------
`batch_resolve_entities` resolves wikilink targets in three tiers. The middle tier — for
targets with no type hint — ordered by `occurrence_count`, a column that exists in
migrations/020_entity_registry.sql (RegenAI-era) and in ZERO tables of `personal_koi`.
So that tier did not merely rank badly: it raised `UndefinedColumnError` every time it was
reached, before any relationship was written and before the Step 3b vault-path fallback
that resolves exactly these targets correctly.

`POST /register-entity` catches the exception, logs a warning and returns success, so a
note whose frontmatter contained one untyped target silently lost ALL of its relationships.

Reached how: `parse_wikilink` does `folder, name = path.rsplit('/', 1)`, so a nested path
`Meetings/BKC COP/2026-02-09 BKC COP Meeting` yields the folder key
`"meetings/bkc cop"`, which is not in `folder_type_map` -> type_hint None. Nested is the
vault's actual convention, so essentially every meeting wikilink took the broken tier.
Measured 2026-08-23: 1,984 of 6,112 vault notes with a sync target carried at least one
untyped target, and `sourced_from` had 0 edges from a nested path against 1,944 declared
in the vault.

WHY NOT "just delete the ORDER BY"
----------------------------------
`DISTINCT ON` without a total order picks an arbitrary row per name, so the tier would
become nondeterministic instead of broken. The replacement must both exist and rank:
`(merged_into IS NOT NULL), id` prefers a live row over a tombstone and then breaks ties
stably. The pre-existing comment claiming this tier "actively PREFERS the tombstone,
which typically has the higher count" described behaviour that never once executed.
