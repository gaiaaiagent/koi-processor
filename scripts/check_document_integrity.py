"""Run both document-ingest integrity gates against a document, read-only.

Issues #62 (identity) and #64 (semantic quality). This exists so the gates are
something an operator can RUN before ingesting a paper, not something that was
demonstrated once in a session transcript. A check with no entry point is a check
nothing reaches.

Nothing here writes. Every statement is a SELECT or a pure computation.

    GATE 1 — identity
        Collect the payload's complete distinct typed endpoint set, classify each
        against the live registry, and freeze the resolvable ones. Reports every
        blocker (counted BEFORE the display truncation), the bijection over the
        resolvable endpoints, every endpoint a real ingest would pre-register WITH
        THE TYPE it would be minted as, and which endpoints were only found by the
        #61 compatibility read (their stored normalized_text is stale).

    THE PAYLOAD IS THE PRODUCTION MERGE. With no --payload, the stored window
    extractions are merged by `api.extraction_merge.merge_extractions` — the same
    function the extractor calls — so the gate reports what production would do.
    An earlier version de-duplicated entities by (name, type) here while the
    extractor coerces by name, and BLOCKED 100 of 1,755 cached documents that
    production ingests, while reporting "0 cross-window coercion(s)" because it
    never ran the code that produces them (independent review of PR #66, M7).

    A --payload file is a VALIDATION ARTIFACT: the output of
    scripts/curate_cached_payload.py (already the production merge), checked
    against the live graph exactly as the stored windows would be. It is NOT a
    replay input — no ingest path consumes it, by design, until #69 supplies a
    sanctioned reconciliation mechanism. Its `curation.document_rid` must match
    --document-rid or the gate refuses (exit 3) before touching the database.

    GATE 2 — semantic quality
        Deterministic, no model call. Chunk coverage, citation range and support,
        predicate concentration, discourse variety.

Usage:

    # against a live document's stored extraction
    python scripts/check_document_integrity.py --document-rid document:<sha256>

    # against a curated payload file, checked against the live graph
    python scripts/check_document_integrity.py \
        --document-rid document:<sha256> \
        --payload ~/Documents/sources/<slug>/ingest/curated-deep-extraction.json

    # machine-readable
    python scripts/check_document_integrity.py --document-rid ... --json

Exit codes
    0  both gates pass
    1  a gate failed (identity blocked, or semantic verdict is `fail`)
    2  semantic verdict is `review` and --strict-review was given, OR identity is
       `pass_after_preregistration` and --strict-preregistration was given
    3  misconfiguration (document not found, payload unreadable, no chunks)

`review` exits 0 by default. It means "a human should look", not "this is broken",
and making it fail by default would push operators toward running with the gate
off — which is worse than a verdict nobody blocks on.

`pass_after_preregistration` ALSO exits 0, and that is a correction (2026-09-14).
The status was introduced precisely to say "the only unbound endpoints are ones
that do not exist yet, which is every first ingest" — and then the exit code
lumped it in with `blocked` anyway, so the two michaelgarfield documents whose
sole finding was a not-yet-existing essay reported exit 1. An operator reading the
number rather than the word would conclude the gate had refused them. Use
--strict-preregistration when you genuinely mean "this payload must create
nothing".
