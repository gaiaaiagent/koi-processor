"""extract_rid_type must parse ORNs by the grammar, not by substring guessing.

The original implementation had two hardcoded branches:

    if "koi-net." in rid:  ... split on "koi-net."
    if "entity:"  in rid:  ... split on "entity:"

Both are substring tests against a structured identifier, and they were wrong in
three ways that mattered once the filter began to FAIL CLOSED (divergence 10):

  * 'orn:personal-koi.entity:abc' contains "entity:", so it returned 'Abc' —
    the SLUG, capitalized, presented as a type. An edge scoped {Abc} would have
    matched it.
  * 'orn:personal-koi.doclink:x' matched neither branch -> None -> now excluded
    from every edge.
  * 'orn:personal-koi.vault-file:x' likewise, which blocked the divergence-1
    namespace migration outright: moving off the squatted koi-net.* namespace
    would have made vault files undeliverable.

The 'orn:entity:{type}/{slug}' form the second branch existed for has ZERO rows
on either node (checked in koi_net_events and entity_registry, with
'orn:personal-koi.entity:' = 81,552 as the positive control), so it was dead.

It now uses rid_lib.core.RID.from_string — the same parser upstream uses — which
is the point: stop hand-rolling a parser for a format someone else specifies.
