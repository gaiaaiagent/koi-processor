#!/bin/bash
# Scheduled entry point for ingestion-time discourse discovery (issue #60):
# one worker pass that claims at most one queued job, plans it (read-only) and
# applies it (one short transaction). Invoked by the
# com.personal-koi.discourse-discovery LaunchAgent, or by hand.
#
# Jobs exist only for sources ingested with
#   scripts/ingest_document.py --tier thorough --discourse-discovery
# so with an empty queue a pass connects, finds nothing and exits 0.
#
# Same lessons as run_embedding_repair.sh: REPO_DIR resolves from this script's
# own location, each missing piece has its own exit code, and the plist has no
# KeepAlive. KOI_DISCOURSE_DISCOVERY is set here, for this process only. No
# provider secrets are loaded: the worker embeds with local Ollama and refuses
# any other model.
#
# Overrides: DISCOURSE_DISCOVERY_REPO_DIR, DISCOURSE_DISCOVERY_PYTHON,
# DISCOURSE_DISCOVERY_DSN, DISCOURSE_DISCOVERY_STATE.
