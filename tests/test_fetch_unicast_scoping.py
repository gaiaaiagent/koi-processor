"""Unicast scoping on /koi-net/{manifests,bundles}/fetch.

Divergence 3 is an intentional fork: upstream buffers events per peer at WRITE
time; we store one broadcast row and filter per peer at READ time. `target_node`
is therefore this fork's representation of "in that peer's buffer", and serving
a peer an event unicast to a different node is reading someone else's buffer.

`poll()` has always enforced this. The fetch handlers never did, so any peer
holding an approved edge could fetch any unicast event by naming its RID —
measured 2026-09-07 on the live DB as 22,885 unicast rows, all carrying
contents (19,956 to nuc-personal, 1,463 to shawn, 1,445 to friend-e2e).

These tests pin the SQL predicate the handlers now use. The prior attempt at
fetch scoping shipped with no tests and was withdrawn in review; the specific
gap was that it was verified against hand-picked RIDs rather than against the
shapes the system is normally in, so each case below is a shape, not an example.
