"""Proves the provider-HTTP hardening actually FIRES (gaiaaiagent/koi-processor#36).

Config inspection is not proof. On 2026-07-15 the wedged callers *looked* configured —
they had `timeout=300` — and still hung for 40 minutes. So these tests stand up real
sockets that misbehave in the two ways observed in the incident and assert the client
raises promptly instead of hanging.

  1. SILENT SERVER — accepts the connection, reads the request, then never replies.
     The read timeout must fire.
  2. HALF-CLOSED / CLOSE_WAIT REUSE — the server accepts, replies, then sends FIN. The
     socket sits in the pool half-closed. A later request must not hang on it. This is
     the exact shape from the incident, and the defence is `keepalive_expiry`, not the
     timeout.
  3. LIMITS REACH THE POOL — regression test for a bug in the fix itself: httpx uses
     `limits=` only to build its DEFAULT transport, so `Client(limits=…, transport=…)`
     silently DISCARDS them. That shipped keepalive_expiry=5.0 (httpx default) while
     looking correct.

No network access and no API keys required.
