"""Tests for the credential write-path guard.

The positive controls below are SHAPES MEASURED FROM THE REAL CREDENTIAL FACTS
that sat in knowledge_facts for ~4.5 months (retracted 2026-09-01), not shapes
invented for the test. That distinction is the whole point: the obvious guard to
write requires mixed upper+lower+digit, and every one of the three real tokens is
32-char *lowercase hex*, so an invented control would have passed while the
actual secrets walked through.

No real secret value appears here. Only the measured shape is reproduced.
