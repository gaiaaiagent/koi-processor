-- Rollback for migration 123: document history
-- =============================================================================
-- The journal is the ONLY record of what was superseded and why, and the claims are the
-- only record of sticky retention policy. NEITHER IS RE-DERIVABLE.
--
-- The export is NOT a comment any more -- see the EXPORT block below line 22. It used to
-- live here, commented out, under the word "EXPORT FIRST:". A reviewer ran this file as
-- shipped: it destroyed 511 ownership rows and 2 journal edges, printed only
-- "DROP TABLE / DROP TABLE / DELETE 1", and exited 0 with "down assertion PASSED".
-- An instruction in a comment is not a step.
--
-- This drops exactly FOUR objects and one ledger row:
--   view  document_source_projection
--   table document_supersession
--   table document_source_claim
--   column session_discourse_moves.superseded_at   <- and, with it, leg E's stamps
--
-- It touches NOTHING on koi_memories or koi_memory_chunks. koi_memories.superseded_at and
-- koi_memories.previous_version_id are PRE-EXISTING -- created by
-- migrations/003_create_isolated_koi_tables.sql's own CREATE TABLE, together with
-- idx_koi_memories_superseded -- and are neither created by 123 nor dropped here. Reading
-- "the nullable column" as koi_memories.superseded_at would be catastrophic; it is
-- session_discourse_moves.superseded_at and nothing else.
-- =============================================================================
\set ON_ERROR_STOP on

-- =============================================================================
-- EXPORT -- runs, and MUST be below \set ON_ERROR_STOP on. Placement is the whole
-- point, not style. Measured both ways against this database:
--   \copy ABOVE \set ON_ERROR_STOP  ->  failed export prints one error, psql CONTINUES
--                                       to the DROPs, and EXITS 0.        (exit=0, reached=1)
--   \copy BELOW \set ON_ERROR_STOP  ->  failed export ABORTS before anything drops.
--                                                                          (exit=3, reached=0)
-- So the obvious fix -- lifting the commented lines to the header -- reproduces the
-- original defect with the appearance of having repaired it.
--
-- The paths are LITERAL, deliberately. psql's \copy does NOT interpolate :'var' in a
-- filename -- it passes the variable name through as a literal string. Measured:
--   \copy (SELECT 1) TO :'sup_path' CSV
--   -> ERROR: syntax error at or near "'sup_path'" ... TO STDOUT 'sup_path' CSV HEADER
-- so a timestamped-variable version LOOKS parameterised and writes nothing. If you want a
-- timestamp, rename the files afterwards; do not reintroduce the variable.
-- psql 14 does expand a leading ~ in a \copy path (verified).
-- A re-run overwrites these two files -- acceptable, because a second run has nothing to
-- export (the tables are already gone) and aborts at the first \copy instead of dropping.
-- =============================================================================

-- WHAT THIS DOWN MIGRATION DOES NOT UNDO, stated rather than implied:
--   * rows already stamped in koi_memories.superseded_at  -> use the kill switch
--     (POST /history/read-filter {"read_filter":"off"}) to make them visible again;
--   * koi_memory_chunks already deleted by an apply       -> re-ingest from the git archive;
--   * rows already hard-deleted under history_policy='drop' -> the archive is the only copy,
--     which is why the --no-hardlinks mirror is a hard predecessor of any chunk-deleting run;
--   * document_ingestion_log                              -> never written or deleted by 123.
-- Those are runtime effects, recovered by the rollback STEPS, not by this DDL.
