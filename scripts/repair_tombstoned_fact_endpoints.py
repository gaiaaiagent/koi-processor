"""Rewrite knowledge_facts endpoints that point at tombstoned entities.

`/entities/merge` tombstones the loser and rewires the references it knows about. The
resolution path used by `POST /knowledge/add` did not follow merged_into, so facts
ingested AFTER a merge could be written against the dead URI. Those rows are invisible
when you query the surviving entity — the fact exists, is embedded, is retrievable by
text, and simply is not attached to the thing it is about.

Live count when this was written: 21 facts with a tombstoned subject, 32 with a
tombstoned object, 41 distinct rows. Examples: "The BioFi Project was co-founded by
Samantha Power…" bound to a dead `Biofi`; "Neo4j is a graph database…" bound to a dead
`Neo4j`.

This repairs the rows. The code fix that stops new ones is in knowledge_router's
`_resolve_or_create` (all four tiers now route through `_accept`, which follows the
merge) and in `resolve_entity_multi_tier`, which now guarantees a live URI at a single
choke point. Repairing without that fix would just refill.

Resolution is TRANSITIVE — merges chain, and 14 registry rows are two hops from a live
entity, so a single-hop rewrite lands on another tombstone and looks like it worked.

Dry-run by default. `--apply` writes, inside one transaction, after copying every
affected row to a timestamped backup table.
