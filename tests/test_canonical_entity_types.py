"""The canonical entity-type vocabulary, and the drift it is supposed to prevent.

WHY Document AND Event ARE CANONICAL (2026-08-24)
-------------------------------------------------
They were 390 of the 421 rows carrying a type outside the canonical 28, and the obvious
reading — "non-canonical means wrong, retype them" — did not survive measurement:

  - They are not typos. They are schema.org types written deliberately by two intake
    pipelines (`johar-corpus-intake-v1` -> Document, `extract-session-entities` -> Event).
  - They are load-bearing: Document carries 598 relationship edges, Event carries 498
    document links. Retyping rewires all of it.
  - Retrieval never cared. A Document entity probed through /knowledge/unified-search
    ranks FIRST, identically to a canonical control, and all 390 rows carry embeddings.
  - Resolution never failed either: unknown types fall back to UNKNOWN_TYPE_SCHEMA, which
    is STRICTER (0.90/0.95) than most canonical types. They resolved conservatively.
  - No mapping into the existing 28 is defensible. An `Event` extracted from a session
    transcript is not a `Meeting` with attendees.

So the cost of them being "non-canonical" was a `Misc` vault folder and a log warning,
and the honest fix is to admit what the graph already contains.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
---------------------
Admitting a type is not the same as enforcing the vocabulary. `allowed_entity_types`
(migration 111) holds the canonical list and is read by NOTHING — no foreign key on
entity_registry, no create-path guard. Until that changes, a cleanup regenerates: the
16-type tail accumulated exactly that way. Tracked as its own decision.
