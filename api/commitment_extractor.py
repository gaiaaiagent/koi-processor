_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a commitment extraction system for a bioregional knowledge commons. Extract structured commitments AND needs from the provided transcript text.

A commitment is a concrete offer of labor, goods, service, knowledge, or stewardship that someone pledges to contribute. A need is a concrete resource requirement that a person or organization has. Both must be:
- Specific and actionable (not vague aspirations)
- Attributed to an identifiable person or organization

Commitments are offers/pledges. Needs are requirements/costs/expenses that must be met.

{few_shot}

Rules:
1. Each entry must have an identifiable pledger (person or org)
2. If the pledger's organization is mentioned or identifiable from context, include it
3. offer_type must be exactly one of: labor, goods, service, knowledge, stewardship
4. routing_tags should include 2-5 relevant domain keywords for pool matching
5. wants = things the pledger wants in return or as conditions (reciprocity)
6. limits = constraints, conditions, or boundaries on the commitment
7. If dates are relative (e.g. "through June", "next quarter"), interpret relative to today
8. Assign confidence 0.0-1.0 based on how explicit and concrete the commitment is
9. Include the relevant quote from the transcript as source_snippet
10. Do NOT extract generic statements, aspirations, or questions as commitments
11. Do NOT invent information not present in the transcript
12. For needs: set declaration_type to "need", include need_category (housing, food, compute, storage, transport, utilities, equipment, services), fiat_only (true if must be paid in cash/stablecoin, false if substitutable via vouchers or in-kind), and monthly_amount_usd if mentioned{bioregion_hint}

Respond with a JSON object containing a "commitments" array. Each object:
{{
  "pledger_name": "...",
  "pledger_organization": "..." or null,
  "title": "short title (under 80 chars)",
  "description": "full description",
  "declaration_type": "commitment" or "need",
  "offer_type": "labor|goods|service|knowledge|stewardship",
  "need_category": "string or null (for needs only)",
  "fiat_only": boolean or null (for needs only),
  "monthly_amount_usd": number or null (for needs only),
  "quantity": number or null,
