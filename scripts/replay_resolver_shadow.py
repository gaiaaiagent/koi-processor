"""Replay historical resolution attempts through both token-overlap policies.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
scripts/analyze_resolver_shadow.py needs 1,000 sampled attempts that actually reach the
fuzzy guard boundary, across every production call site. Live sampling cannot deliver
that: at 10% sampling and ~60 organic entity creations a day it yields roughly 6
observations a day (~170 days), and 10 of the 13 expected callers have no organic
traffic at all, so no amount of waiting covers them. The analyzer already anticipated
this -- it accepts `--fixture-caller` and its own header says writing those fixtures is
part of this phase.

This produces the same counterfactual data in one run, from the registry itself.

WHAT IT REPLAYS, AND WHAT THAT IS WORTH
---------------------------------------
For each sampled name it asks the counterfactual that matters: *if this name arrived
fresh, which OTHER row would the fuzzy tier match, and would legacy and strict agree?*
The row itself is excluded -- in production Tier 1 exact-matches it and the fuzzy tier
is never reached, so leaving it in would replay a decision that never happens.

The candidate loop below mirrors resolve_entity_multi_tier's Tier 2a exactly, including
the per-type common guards, and calls the same shadow observer. It is a replay, not a
reimplementation of the policy: the guards are imported, never restated.

WHAT IT CANNOT ANSWER
---------------------
1. Novel input shapes. It resamples names already in the registry, so a name shaped
   unlike anything seen so far is not represented. Live sampling stays on for that.
2. Latency. In a replay the shadow comparison IS the work, so shadow_overhead_ratio is
   ~1.0 and meaningless. Records are tagged `"replay": true` and the analyzer excludes
   them from the overhead percentile -- overhead is a live-traffic question. Emitting
   them untagged would push p95 over the threshold and fail the gate for a reason that
   has nothing to do with the policy.
