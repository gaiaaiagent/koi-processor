"""Admin endpoints — entity merge / redirect.

Provides ``POST /entities/merge`` (service-token gated): merge a *loser* entity
into a *survivor*, rewiring every entity-URI reference in one transaction, then
TOMBSTONING the loser (``entity_registry.merged_into = survivor``) instead of
hard-deleting it. The loser is never deleted because the ON DELETE CASCADE FKs
on ``entity_relationships`` / ``pending_relationships`` would otherwise wipe the
very rows the merge just rewired.

Also exposes ``GET /entities/{uri}/resolve`` to follow a merged_into redirect
chain to the canonical live URI.

Routes are prefix-relative — prefix "/entities" is applied at mount in
personal_ingest_api.py.

A "retype" (e.g. a Concept that should be a Person) is expressed as a merge:
the entity type is encoded in the fuseki_uri prefix (…entity:organization-… vs
…entity:person-…), so merging into a correctly-typed survivor URI re-types it.

Reference surface (verified live against personal_koi 2026-05-29, all keyed by
entity_registry.fuseki_uri):

  Collision-prone (rewire-then-dedup; have a UNIQUE constraint a blind rewrite
  could violate):
    * entity_relationships  UNIQUE(subject_uri, predicate, object_uri)  [FK CASCADE]
    * document_entity_links UNIQUE(document_rid, entity_uri)            [additive mention_count]
    * pending_relationships UNIQUE(COALESCE(subject_uri,''),
                                   COALESCE(object_uri,''), predicate,
                                   raw_unknown_label, unknown_side)     [FK CASCADE]

  Plain UPDATE (no UNIQUE on the URI columns):
    knowledge_facts(subject_uri,object_uri), claims(entity_uri,claimant_uri,
    operator_uri), claim_attestations(reviewer_uri), entity_rid_mappings(
    canonical_uri), intent_registry(entity_uri,publisher_uri), task_registry(
    owner_uri,project_uri), commitments(pledger_uri,evidence_uri),
    commitment_pools(steward_uri,bioregion_uri), signals(subject_uri),
    requirements(subject_uri), assertion_history(subject,object_uri)*,
    koi_extraction_records(subject_uri,object_uri)*    (* RDF mirror, empty today)

  Array columns (array_replace):
    claim_attestations.evidence_uris, task_registry.collaborator_uris

  JSONB metadata (text-replace of the embedded URI):
    claims.metadata + the other *.metadata columns + entity_registry.metadata
    (loser row excluded)

  Aliases: the loser's entity_text + aliases are unioned into the survivor's
  aliases so the survivor stays findable by the loser's name(s).

    # Closure — the non-monotone operation this surface was missing.
    #
    # Asserting and relating are MONOTONE: they commute, they are order-independent,
    # they never retract a conclusion. Closure (REFUTED / SCOPED / SUPERSEDED /
    # authority change) is NOT, and by CALM (Hellerstein 2010; Ameloot/Neven/Van den
    # Bussche, JACM 2013) it admits no coordination-free implementation. We do not
    # pretend otherwise — we split it:
    #   * entity_closure_log        — APPEND-ONLY. One row per attributable act.
    #                                 Never UPDATEd, never DELETEd. Stays monotone.
    #   * metadata->'closure'       — the DERIVED PROJECTION of the latest act.
    #                                 Non-monotone, but a deterministic function of
    #                                 the log, so always recomputable and never
    #                                 authoritative on its own.
    # Replay determinism without pretending to schedule invariance. Reopening is
    # just another act (status=OPEN); nothing is ever overwritten.
    #
    # Without this, a refutation could only be appended as *facts* while the
    # hypothesis kept full retrieval standing — which is how a killed experiment
    # (holonomy on the RAGE concept graph, permutation p = 0.980, 2026-06-29) was
    # re-proposed on 2026-07-14 with nothing in the substrate able to object.
