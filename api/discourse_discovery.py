"""Ingestion-time cross-source discourse discovery: the job a newly extracted
source gets, what binds it, and its status (issue #60).

Off by default. The extractor enqueues only with KOI_DISCOURSE_INGEST_DISCOVERY=1,
and only moves whose extraction binding this run recorded with its input
(KOI_DISCOURSE_BINDINGS=1). scripts/discourse_discovery_worker.py drains the
jobs later, so extraction never waits on retrieval: a read-only plan, then a
short candidate-only apply (api.discourse_links.plan_discovery / apply_plan).

A job is bound to the source revision captured with the extraction input, the
extraction run and its input digest, the exact moves and their
representations, the caller context and the embedding and retrieval profile.
When any of these no longer holds the job refuses with status 'stale'; the
newer extraction enqueues its own job. Nothing here writes a binding, so
claims extracted before bindings were recorded never become admissible. A
failed or stale job leaves the ingested document, its moves and its bindings
as they were.
