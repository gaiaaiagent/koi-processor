"""
Unit tests for the /sql table allowlist (api/routers/query_router.py).

The allowlist had no test at all until 2026-08-26, which is how the derived
knowledge graph — knowledge_facts (59k rows), knowledge_episodes,
document_entity_links — stayed unreachable from the /sql escape hatch while
every other surface served it. A caller could find an entity and never its
facts.

These tests pin two things:
  1. The knowledge-graph tables are reachable (the regression that motivated
     this file).
  2. The guards that make read-only exposure safe still hold — writes,
     multi-statement, catalog access, and inline literals are all refused.
