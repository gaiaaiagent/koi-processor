# koi-dump-ok — is there a VALID pg_dump custom-format archive, recent enough to rely on?
#
# Written because `pg_restore --list` CANNOT distinguish a truncated dump from a complete
# one. Measured on this machine against a real 4.25GB partial (a dump killed mid-COPY by a
# restart) and the 12.46GB complete dump taken the day before:
#
#     pg_restore --list  partial -> exit 0, 1183 TOC entries   <- indistinguishable
#     pg_restore --list  good    -> exit 0, 1183 TOC entries
#     pg_restore -f /dev/null partial -> exit 1 in ~22s  "could not read from input file: end of file"
#     pg_restore -f /dev/null good    -> exit 0 in ~96s
#
# Only a FULL READ separates them, so that is what this does. It is slow on purpose.
#
# Usage:
#   koi-dump-ok <dir> [max_age_hours]     # newest dump in dir must be valid and fresh
#   koi-dump-ok --file <dump>             # verify one specific file, ignore age
#
# Exit: 0 valid (and fresh, if an age was given) · 1 invalid/truncated · 2 none found
#       · 3 too old · 4 usage
