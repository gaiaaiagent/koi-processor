"""Apply audited TYPE overrides to a document's cached extraction, without replaying.

Issue #68 requirement 6: "Preserve support for cached historical payloads and
audited type overrides used during repair."

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A cached extraction produced under an older type contract can carry a type the
contract now admits a better answer for. On 2026-09-14 two named essays —
`The End of Hoop Jumping` and `How To Think About Science` — were cached as
`Project` because no schema admitted `Document`. Widening the schema does not
rewrite what is already cached, and re-running the extractor to get a better type
means paying for the whole document again AND accepting a different extraction.

So: take the cached payload as-is, apply exactly the overrides an operator has
audited, validate the result against the live schema, run the PRODUCTION merge over
it, and write it out as a curated payload for `check_document_integrity.py --payload`.

THE OUTPUT IS A VALIDATION ARTIFACT, NOT A REPLAY INPUT
-------------------------------------------------------
Nothing consumes this file except the read-only gate. `extract_deep_documents.py`
has no `--payload` flag, on purpose: a replay reads the stored windows, and the only
way an audited override can reach a replay is by reaching the cache through a
mechanism that #69 (transactional rollback / replay reconciliation) has yet to
define. Until then this file answers one question — "would the identity and quality
gates pass with these overrides applied?" — and asserts nothing about what a replay
would write. `curation.document_rid` is stamped so the gate can refuse to check it
against a different document.

Nothing here writes to the database. Every statement is a SELECT.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY REFUSES
----------------------------
  * an override naming a type the contract does not admit
  * an override naming a label the cached payload does not contain (a typo that
    silently did nothing is the failure this whole issue is about)
  * an override whose label is ALREADY that type (a no-op dressed as a decision)

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK, AND WHY
-------------------------------
It does not ask whether the new type conflicts with a live entity of another type.
That is the identity gate's job and it is genuinely separate: retyping a payload
endpoint that is already bound to a live row of the old type converts a clean
binding into a `cross_type_conflict`, which is CORRECT — such a label needs an
operator `/entities/retype` on the graph, not a payload edit. Run
`check_document_integrity.py --payload <out>` afterwards; that is the check.

Usage:
    python scripts/curate_cached_payload.py \
        --document-rid substack-corpus:michaelgarfield:scenius \
        --retype "The End of Hoop Jumping=Document" \
        --out ~/Documents/sources/.../scenius-curated.json

Exit codes
    0  curated payload written (or --dry-run reported cleanly)
    2  an override was rejected, or the document has no cached extraction
    3  the curated payload does not validate against the schema
