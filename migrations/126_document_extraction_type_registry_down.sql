-- Migration 126 DOWN: un-designate Document and Event as extractable
-- =============================================================================
-- Date:     2026-09-14
-- Issue:    #68
--
-- Apply:    psql -d personal_koi -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f migrations/126_document_extraction_type_registry_down.sql
--
-- Transactional (in-file BEGIN; … COMMIT;, `\set ON_ERROR_STOP on` first) and
-- removes the koi_migrations ledger row 126 recorded — house pattern of 124/125,
-- added 2026-09-14 after review finding M8. The assertion is an exact SET check
-- for migration 111's seven, for the same reason the up file's is: a count of 7
-- cannot tell "the seven" from "six of them plus a stray".
--
-- =============================================================================
-- READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING IT
-- =============================================================================
-- This does NOT delete the Document or Event rows, and must not: 390 live
-- entities carry those two types, with 598 relationship edges and 498 document
-- links between them (tests/test_canonical_entity_types.py records the
-- measurement). Deleting the rows would also break allowed_facets' foreign key.
--
-- It clears only the `extractable` designation, returning the registry to
-- migration 111's seven. That is the correct inverse of what 126 asserts.
--
-- Running this while the extractor still admits nine types puts the registry and
-- the code back into exactly the disagreement issue #68 was filed about, and
-- tests/test_document_extraction_type_contract.py will say so. Roll the code back
-- too, or do not roll this back.
